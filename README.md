# React-Shopping-Cart-App üõçÔ∏è

 <br>



#### This is a shopping application. We see the information in the cards in the project through the API. We can add these cards to the cart and remove them. We can see the total amount in the card section. This project was completed using CSS, Tailwind and React.js, and my purpose in making this project was to experience the basic React-Router-Dom and Context API features. The project was made as a responsive design.<br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
- Master layout creation
- CSS
- Tailwind
- React hooks
- Regular Expression
- Responsive Design
- Context API
- React Router DOM
